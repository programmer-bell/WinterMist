# ❄️ WinterMist
A project-based learning journey built with **Django** and **Django REST Framework**, created from absolute scratch.  
WinterMist documents the *real* process of building a modern backend application — including mistakes, rewrites, debugging, best practices, and continuous improvement.

No filters. No skipping hard parts. Just authentic developer growth.

## 🌨️ Why WinterMist?
Developers often learn from polished tutorials where everything magically works.  
But real development is **foggy, messy, full of errors — and that’s where the actual learning happens.**

WinterMist embraces that.

Here you'll find:
- Raw decisions and corrections  
- Thought process behind code changes  
- Failures → fixes → improvements  
- Step-by-step progress as the project evolves  
- Clean explanations written for future-you (or other learners)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Django**
- **Django REST Framework**
- PostgreSQL (depending on future direction)

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Learn Django from the ground up  
- Build a REST API using DRF  
- Understand backend architecture with realistic examples  
- Practice debugging and writing maintainable code  
- Document mistakes and their solutions  
- Show how a developer grows through iteration
